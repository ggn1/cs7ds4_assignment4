"A large business group has entered into travelling service industry by launching a new business of Bus Services. The venture will offer routes between different cities of the country with the
aim of providing safe and timely completion of journey. Following story card is developed for
inquiries as well as booking by the customers for a particular route:Inquiries and Booking by the customers
Inquiries will be made on the basis of either the source and destination cities, for days with start time of different services or about fares of different routes. For booking of a ruote, the user (a staff member) will be required to select the source and destination cities as well as the date of travelling for the customer. On submission of the
information, the travel start time, different classes and their fares are displayed along with the number of available seats to the user. The users will then fill necessary data and submit the request to system for final booking. After validating the desired number of seats, the customer will then be asked about the payment mode (either
cash or credit card). After payment, number of available seats will be updated accordingly and the system will be required to print the payment voucher.Break down the above story into different tasks and list them sequentially.

"In 2000, a software house worked inconsistently on its product following software development
process model which has relatively longer duration than the process models of today. The benefit
of using longer process model was the visibility and well-defined stages. In 2003, they got the first
client-based project based on mathematics named ""Graph plotter"". The management finally took
uncertain decision to follow a process model with short span to deliver the product in increments
(obviously with less but core functionalities) after fetching the requirements with help of mockups.
The team was formulated based on 7 members. The team members were able to communicate
with each other because of complexity and low modularity of project. Client communicated the flow
to developer as: ""When an equation is given to the system, it solves the equation and shows the
results of variables along with several types of graphs. The user selects a type of graph and graph
will be plotted. User has the option to save or discard the graph"".

"A software house gets the project to develop a hotel management system for a five-star hotel with
administrative features. Administrator can add different rooms, update the status of room furniture,
pictures of type of rooms, view / approve the pending request. The application contains additional
features of online reservation, status of hotel rooms (as communicated by client). There are some
features which are not clear at the moment. The software house visits hotel to get information
regarding additional functionalities, environment of organization, behavior / level of individual users,
The initial release is to be delivered after 3 months as defined in water fall model. After first release, the
hotel management upgraded the systems in entire hotel. Few years later, the hotel management asked
software house to implement a functionality of email to the clients for reservation status within 24 hours
if certain user reserves hotel room online.
